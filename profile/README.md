## setup Jupyter
Before using Jupyter, Jupyter need some requirements:
<br>
first, if you dont download an executable version, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in the [Python website](https://www.python.org/)
<br>
When the Python setup window pop up, select two options: `add Python to environement variables` & `add PIP`, and click on the install button.
<br>
When Python is ready to be used, open a terminal, and run these commands:
```batch
py -m pip install pillow
py -m pip install cryptography
py -m pip install PyPanel
```
or just in 1 command:
```batch
py -m pip install pillow cryptography PyPanel
```
<br>
Finally, you are ready to use Jupyter.
